# GitHub Repo Manager

This is a quick and simple app for applying bulk actions (set private, set public, archive, delete) to GitHub repos.

It's currently super dirty and has a bit of hardcoding going on in places. I may come back and clean it up in the near future. But since it was intended for personal use and not really for distribution (and it's already finished helping me do what I wanted), it'll probably stay like this forever.
